# LearningResponsiveCSS
A tiny assignment to learn and understand the responsive construct.

I started the design for desktop first and then used the media queries and the 'col-mx' classes to make it work for mobiles, unlike the mobile first approach of some frameworks.

I have mostly tried to do the job using pure CSS and JS.
